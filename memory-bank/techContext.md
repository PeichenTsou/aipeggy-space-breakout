- **NEW**: Performance profiling for theme transition optimization

**No Build Process (Maintained):**

- No webpack, gulp, or other build tools for deployment
- No transpilation or minification required
- No package.json or node_modules
- Direct HTML file execution with enhanced internal architecture
- **NEW**: Documentation files separate from main game file

**Enhanced Development Tools:**

- **JSDoc Validation**: Ensure comprehensive documentation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Frame rate analysis across themes
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Compatibility verification
- **Theme Testing**: Visual consistency across all themes

## Enhanced Environment Configuration

**Multi-File Development, Single-File Deployment:**

- **Development**: Multiple .md files + main index.html
- **Production**: Single index.html file (can be deployed alone)
- **Documentation**: Separate .md files for comprehensive guidance
- **No environment variables**: All configuration embedded in code
- **Theme Configuration**: JSON-like objects within JavaScript

**Enhanced File Structure:**

```
AIPeggy/
├── index.html (main enhanced game file)
├── README.md (comprehensive game guide)
├── GAMEPLAY.md (detailed mechanics guide)
├── TECHNICAL.md (architecture documentation)
├── CHANGELOG.md (version history)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md (development guidelines)
└── memory-bank/ (project context files)
```

## Enhanced Version Control
