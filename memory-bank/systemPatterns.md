## Critical Implementation Paths

**Game Initialization**: Theme setup → Canvas setup → Brick generation → Game loop start
**Theme Switching**: 'T' key press → Theme index cycling → CSS class update → Color propagation → Visual transition
**Ball Physics**: Position update → Wall collision → Brick collision → Paddle collision → AI assistance → Theme-aware effects
**AI Analysis**: Enhanced metrics collection → Sophisticated performance calculation → Assistance level determination → Invisible physics adjustment
**Power-Up Flow**: Brick destruction → AI-adjusted drop chance → Theme-aware creation → Fall physics → Collection → Effect activation → Timer management
**Particle Effects**: Event trigger → Theme-aware particle creation → Physics simulation → Lifecycle management → Cleanup

## Enhanced Data Flow

**Input**: Keyboard/Mouse → Event Handlers → Paddle Position + Theme Changes
**Theme Management**: Theme Switch → Configuration Update → CSS Application → Color Propagation → Visual Transition
**Physics**: Ball Position → Collision Detection → Velocity Adjustment → AI Assistance → Position Update
**AI Metrics**: Game Events → Advanced Performance Tracking → Sophisticated Analysis → Invisible Assistance Adjustment
**Rendering**: Game State + Theme Configuration → Object Properties → Theme-Aware Canvas Drawing → Conditional Visual Effects
**Particle System**: Game Events → Theme-Aware Particle Creation → Physics Update → Alpha-Blended Rendering → Cleanup

## Integration Points

**Browser APIs**: Canvas 2D Context, requestAnimationFrame, Event Listeners, CSS Transitions
**Theme System**: CSS Classes, Computed Styles, Smooth Transitions
**No External Integrations**: Completely self-contained system with enhanced capabilities
