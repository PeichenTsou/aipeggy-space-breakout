# Project Brief

## Project Name

AIPeggy - AI Brick Ball Game (Enhanced Edition)

## Core Requirements

Create a professional-quality visual Brick Ball (Breakout/Arkanoid) game with intelligent adaptive features, multiple visual themes, and clean modular architecture. The AI analyzes player performance and subtly adjusts game physics, power-up timing, and assistance levels to maintain optimal difficulty while providing an engaging experience across different visual styles.

## Project Goals

- **Primary**: Build a complete, playable Brick Ball game with AI assistance and multiple themes
- **Secondary**: Implement invisible difficulty adjustment that maintains player agency
- **Tertiary**: Create engaging visual effects and smooth gameplay experience across all themes
- **Quaternary**: Demonstrate professional code architecture and comprehensive documentation
- **Success Criteria**: Game runs offline in browser, AI helps invisibly, themes switch smoothly, code serves as learning resource

## Enhanced Scope (v2.0.0)

**INCLUDED:**

- **Dual Theme System**: 3 distinct visual themes (Cyberpunk, Minimalist, Space)
- **Professional Architecture**: Class-based design with comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- **Complete Documentation Suite**: README, GAMEPLAY, TECHNICAL, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING guides
- **Enhanced AI System**: Refined performance tracking and invisible assistance
- **Theme-Aware Visual Effects**: Particle systems that adapt to current theme
- **Single HTML file game** (maintained constraint with modular internal structure)
- **4 brick types** with theme-appropriate colors and hit requirements
- **3 power-ups**: Wide Paddle, Multi-ball, Slow Ball with theme-specific visuals
- **AI performance tracking** and adaptive assistance (3 levels)
- **Complete game loop**: lives system, scoring, level progression, pause functionality

**ENHANCED FEATURES:**

- **Theme Manager**: Centralized theme handling with smooth transitions
- **Professional Code Quality**: SOLID principles, error handling, performance optimization
- **Cross-Theme Compatibility**: All features work seamlessly across all themes
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Theme selector UI, improved instructions, better feedback
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility and performance validation

**EXCLUDED:**

- External APIs, libraries, or frameworks
- Backend servers or databases
- localStorage persistence
- Machine learning (rule-based AI only)
- Multiple game modes or complex menus
- Sound system (planned for future release)

## Key Stakeholders

- **Developer**: Implementation, architecture, and technical decisions
- **Player**: End user experience, game balance, and visual preferences
- **AI System**: Performance analysis and assistance delivery
- **Contributors**: Code quality, documentation, and feature development
- **Learning Community**: Code serves as educational resource for game development

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Game runs by opening HTML file in browser
- ✅ Smooth 60fps gameplay with proper collision detection across all themes
- ✅ AI assistance activates for struggling players (accuracy < 60%)
- ✅ Power-ups drop and function correctly with theme-appropriate visuals
- ✅ Visual polish with professional appearance in all themes
- ✅ Theme switching works smoothly with 'T' key during gameplay
- ✅ Code architecture demonstrates professional development standards
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provides clear guidance for users and developers

## Enhanced Constraints

**STRICT TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:**

- NO external APIs or services
- NO npm packages or external libraries beyond basic HTML/CSS/JS
- NO backend servers or databases
- Must work completely offline in browser
- **Single HTML file deployment** (maintained for distribution simplicity)
- NO localStorage (store all state in JavaScript variables)
- No build tools, bundlers, or compilation steps required for end users
- **60fps performance** maintained across all themes and browsers

**NEW QUALITY CONSTRAINTS:**

- **Professional Code Standards**: Comprehensive JSDoc, error handling, SOLID principles
- **Theme Consistency**: All features must work identically across all themes
- **Documentation Completeness**: All features documented for users and developers
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested and working on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms, memory management, particle systems

## Project Evolution

### Version 1.0.0 (Original)

- ✅ Basic Breakout gameplay with AI assistance
- ✅ Single cyberpunk theme
- ✅ Core power-up system
- ✅ Functional but basic code structure

### Version 2.0.0 (Enhanced Edition)

- ✅ **Triple Theme System**: Cyberpunk, Minimalist, Space themes
- ✅ **Professional Architecture**: Class-based design with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ **Complete Documentation Suite**: 5 comprehensive .md files
- ✅ **Enhanced AI System**: More sophisticated performance tracking
- ✅ **Theme-Aware Effects**: Particle systems adapt to current theme
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Senior developer standards with JSDoc and error handling
