```

**PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP:**

- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles specific functionality
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Easy to extend and modify individual components
- **Professional Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc across all modules
- **Version Control Ready**: Git repository with proper ignore rules
- **GitHub Showcase Ready**: Professional README with badges and documentation

## Next Steps

**🎯 v4.0.0 MODULAR ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE + GITHUB LIVE**

- All restructuring objectives successfully achieved
- Professional modular architecture implemented
- All v3.0.0 features preserved and enhanced
- Git repository initialized with professional structure
- GitHub-ready documentation created
- **GitHub deployment successful**: https://github.com/PeichenTsou/aipeggy-space-breakout
- **Local development setup**: `python -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000/src/`
- Ready for professional development workflow and collaboration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

**MODULAR ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:**

- **No Build Tools**: Maintained simple HTML import system as requested
- **Professional Structure**: Industry-standard directory organization
- **Preserved Functionality**: All game features work identically to v3.0.0
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Much easier to develop and extend
- **Git Repository**: Professional version control setup
- **Documentation-First**: Comprehensive README for GitHub showcase

## Important Patterns and Preferences (Enhanced)

**ESTABLISHED MODULAR PATTERNS:**

- **Clean Module Separation**: Each file has single responsibility
- **Professional Import Order**: Core → Entities → Systems → Game
- **Consistent Architecture**: All modules follow same documentation standards
