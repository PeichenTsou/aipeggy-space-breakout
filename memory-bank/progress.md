- ✅ **Life Deduction Logic**: Removed incorrect life loss trigger from Ball.js update method
- ✅ **Game.js Control**: Centralized life management in GameManager for proper ball type handling

**📝 IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT NOTES:**

- ✅ **Basic Function Validation**: Added to memory bank - after implementing new features, always verify core game mechanics (ball physics, paddle movement, collision detection, scoring) still work correctly
- ✅ **Memory Bank Management**: DONT forget to update memory bank before asking me to start a new task
- ✅ **No Server Required**: Don't try to use python just let me open directly by html using browser, don't need server at all
